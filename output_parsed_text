Adaptive Self-Supervised Dynamic Influence Learning for
GNN-based Multi-Agent Traffic Signal Control
By Heinz and Pavithra
1. Methodology
To address the problem of evolving spatial and temporal dependencies in
urban traffic systems, we propose a novel adaptive self-supervised learning
framework for constructing dynamic traffic-influence graphs, which are
subsequently integrated into a Graph Neural Network-based Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (GNN-MARL) system. This integrated approach aims
to coordinate signal control policies in real-time, reducing congestion
propagation and improving network traffic efficiency.
1.1 Traffic State Encoding
· Each traffic intersection is considered as an agent that observes its
environment via sensors capturing data such as:
· - Vehicle counts per incoming lane
· - Queue lengths at intersections
· - Inflow and outflow rates
· - Current and previous signal phases
· To convert these raw traffic metrics into a format suitable for downstream
learning, we propose a spatiotemporal encoding mechanism:
· - Temporal features are processed using LSTM or Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to model traffic flow trends.
· - Signal phase information is embedded as learnable vectors.
· - Features are concatenated and passed through a dense encoding layer
to form a fixed-size latent representation per intersection.
· These latent vectors serve as node features for the influence graph
construction process.
1.2 Dynamic Influence Learning
To learn about evolving relationships between intersections, we design a
self-supervised dynamic influence learning module that constructs a weighted
adjacency matrix in real-time.
· Key components:
· - Graph Attention Mechanism: Assigns attention weights to neighboring
nodes based on their encoded features.

· Contrastive Learning: Uses dropout and feature masking to maximize
agreement between positive node pairs.
· - Mutual Information Maximization: Preserves meaningful global
dependencies.
· The resulting dynamic traffic-influence graph updates at every timestep,
capturing short- and long-range dependencies.
1.3 GNN-MARL Integration
· We integrate the dynamically constructed graphs into a GNN-based MARL
system, where a local agent controls each intersection.
· Observation: Node features and messages from dynamically identified
influential neighbors.
· Policy Network: GAT layer followed by a policy head (e.g., PPO or DQN).
· Action: Agent selects the next signal phase.
· Reward: Based on local traffic efficiency.
· This setup allows agents to learn coordinated policies using both local and
non-local context.
1.4 Performance Evaluation
· We evaluate the proposed framework on standard benchmarks using the
following metrics:
· Average Waiting Time per vehicle
· Average Queue Length at intersections
· Throughput: Number of vehicles reaching destinations
· Average Travel Time
. Comparison with static-topology MARL baselines will highlight improvements
in congestion reduction and flow stability.
1.5 Scalability and Robustness
· Scalability: Achieved through GNNs and attention mechanisms with graph
sampling or hierarchical clustering.
· Robustness: Tested under sensor faults, incidents, and varying densities
using dropout regularization and online graph refinement.

2. Novelty Justification and Model Comparison
2.1 Comparative Analysis
Model Graph Type Coordination Dependency Adaptability Learning

PressLight Static Pressure Rule No None Rule-based
MA2C Static Local Info Partial (fixed) Low A2C (shared)

2.2 Limitations of Existing Models
· CoLight assumes a fixed graph, failing to adapt to real-time traffic
fluctuations.
· PressLight relies on handcrafted pressure metrics; it lacks global
coordination.
· MA2C shares limited local info, and does not learn influence dynamically.
2.3 Key Differentiators
· Learns real-time evolving influence graphs using self-supervision.
· Embeds temporal traffic dynamics with LSTM/TCN encoders.
· Integrates attention-based GNNs within a multi-agent RL system.
· Adapts to non-stationary traffic patterns and unexpected events.
· Enhances coordination across distant intersections via influence
propagation.
· Robust against noise, scalable to larger networks.
