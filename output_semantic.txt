Adaptive Self-Supervised Dynamic Influence Learning for
GNN-based Multi-Agent Traffic Signal Control
By Heinz and Pavithra
1. Methodology
To address the problem of evolving spatial and temporal dependencies in
urban traffic systems, we propose a novel adaptive self-supervised learning
framework for constructing dynamic traffic-influence graphs, which are
subsequently integrated into a Graph Neural Network-based Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (GNN-MARL) system. This integrated approach aims
to coordinate signal control policies in real-time, reducing congestion
propagation and improving network traffic efficiency. 1.1 Traffic State Encoding
· Each traffic intersection is considered as an agent that observes its
environment via sensors capturing data such as:
· - Vehicle counts per incoming lane
· - Queue lengths at intersections
· - Inflow and outflow rates
· - Current and previous signal phases
· To convert these raw traffic metrics into a format suitable for downstream
learning, we propose a spatiotemporal encoding mechanism:
· - Temporal features are processed using LSTM or Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to model traffic flow trends. · - Signal phase information is embedded as learnable vectors. · - Features are concatenated and passed through a dense encoding layer
to form a fixed-size latent representation per intersection. · These latent vectors serve as node features for the influence graph
construction process. 1.2 Dynamic Influence Learning
To learn about evolving relationships between intersections, we design a
self-supervised dynamic influence learning module that constructs a weighted
adjacency matrix in real-time. · Key components:
· - Graph Attention Mechanism: Assigns attention weights to neighboring
nodes based on their encoded features.

· Contrastive Learning: Uses dropout and feature masking to maximize
agreement between positive node pairs. · - Mutual Information Maximization: Preserves meaningful global
dependencies. · The resulting dynamic traffic-influence graph updates at every timestep,
capturing short- and long-range dependencies. 1.3 GNN-MARL Integration
· We integrate the dynamically constructed graphs into a GNN-based MARL
system, where a local agent controls each intersection. · Observation: Node features and messages from dynamically identified
influential neighbors. · Policy Network: GAT layer followed by a policy head (e.g., PPO or DQN). · Action: Agent selects the next signal phase. · Reward: Based on local traffic efficiency. · This setup allows agents to learn coordinated policies using both local and
non-local context. 1.4 Performance Evaluation
· We evaluate the proposed framework on standard benchmarks using the
following metrics:
· Average Waiting Time per vehicle
· Average Queue Length at intersections
· Throughput: Number of vehicles reaching destinations
· Average Travel Time
. Comparison with static-topology MARL baselines will highlight improvements
in congestion reduction and flow stability. 1.5 Scalability and Robustness
· Scalability: Achieved through GNNs and attention mechanisms with graph
sampling or hierarchical clustering. · Robustness: Tested under sensor faults, incidents, and varying densities
using dropout regularization and online graph refinement.

2.2 Limitations of Existing Models
· CoLight assumes a fixed graph, failing to adapt to real-time traffic
fluctuations. · PressLight relies on handcrafted pressure metrics; it lacks global
coordination. · MA2C shares limited local info, and does not learn influence dynamically. 2.3 Key Differentiators
· Learns real-time evolving influence graphs using self-supervision. · Embeds temporal traffic dynamics with LSTM/TCN encoders. · Integrates attention-based GNNs within a multi-agent RL system. · Adapts to non-stationary traffic patterns and unexpected events. · Enhances coordination across distant intersections via influence
propagation. · Robust against noise, scalable to larger networks.

Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with AI-Powered Diagnostics 
The Problem: 
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among working-age adults, affecting over 140 million people globally. Early detection is critical, but current diagnostic methods are time-consuming, expensive, and often inaccessible, especially in underserved areas. Despite its prevalence, early detection remains a significant challenge due to: 
High Costs: Traditional diagnostic methods are expensive and require specialized equipment. Limited Access: Many patients, especially in rural or underserved areas, lack access to eye care specialists. Time Delays: Manual screening processes can take days or weeks, delaying critical treatment. As a result, 50% of diabetic patients fail to receive timely screenings, leading to preventable vision loss. The global diabetic retinopathy market is projected to reach $12 billion by 2030, driven by the rising prevalence of diabetes and the growing demand for accessible diagnostic tools. With over 460 million people living with diabetes worldwide, the need for scalable solutions like AI-powered diagnostic system is urgent. The Solution: 
An AI-powered diagnostic platform that will analyse retinal images in less time, providing accurate, affordable, and scalable detection of diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the proposed work is to implement an intelligent DR prediction model that can be used by the common man as well as by the medical practitioners. By leveraging cutting-edge AI models, we aim to: 
Make screenings accessible to millions of patients worldwide. Enable early intervention to prevent blindness. Reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. Why This Matters: 
Impact: Early detection can prevent up to 90% of diabetes-related blindness, improving quality of life for millions. Scalability: Our platform is designed for use in both urban and rural settings, addressing the global need for diabetic retinopathy screenings. Cost-Effectiveness: By automating the diagnostic process, we aim to reduce costs for healthcare providers and patients by 30%. In countries like the UK, where healthcare systems are under immense pressure, patients often face long delays for medical appointments. For example: 
Diabetic retinopathy screening appointments can take up to 6 months to schedule in some regions. Delays in diagnosis and treatment lead to worse health outcomes and higher long-term costs for healthcare systems. Solution Overview and Development Roadmap: 
Phase 1: 
Currently, diagnosing a disease requires a medical professional, which can be a time-consuming process. If there were a smart device capable of detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) in its early stages, it could significantly reduce the rate of vision loss caused by DR. The proposed model introduces an efficient Deep Learning (DL)-based approach for predicting diabetic retinopathy (DR) using images of a patient’s retina. On motivated by the existing issues, an enhanced DL based automated DR detection system is supposed in the proposed work to obtain improved outcomes in developing accurate outcomes with respect to the input data. This work presents an automated deep learning-based detection and classification of retinal fundus images which may further help the ophthalmologists in diagnosing patients accurately and easily. The processes involved in the proposed detection model are Image acquisition, Pre-processing, Segmentation, Feature Extraction, and Classification. Phase 2:  
As technology continues to advance, smartphones are likely to play an increasingly significant role in retinal imaging, contributing to improved eye care accessibility, early disease detection, and patient-centric healthcare solutions. With the increasing prevalence of high-quality cameras on smartphones, along with advancements in imaging technology, capturing retinal images using these devices has become more accessible and cost-effective. The major phases in this system are (1) retinal image capturing device which contains an ophthalmoscopy lens and a smartphone camera and (2) Computer Aided Detection (CAD) system. The intelligence gained from the previous phase is deployed on the CAD system. The integration of the trained model specified above with handheld capturing device will help the user to find the possibility of an early prediction of DR. Phase 3: 
Manual analysis of fundus or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images often leads to high rates of misdiagnosis, is time-consuming, and costly. To address these challenges, automated systems for diagnosing retinal disorders from fundus or OCT images are being developed. For early diagnosis, specialized MI (medical imaging) modality is very important. OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) is one of the highly informative imaging tools used for retinal examination because of its high resolution. In this work, OCT imaging is considered due to its high image quality and its ability to image the retinal layer
