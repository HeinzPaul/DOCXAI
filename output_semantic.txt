OF 2nd APRIL, 1997
As published in Dziennik Ustaw No. 78, item 483
Having regard for the existence and future of our Homeland,
Which recovered, in 1989, the possibility of a sovereign and democratic determination of its fate,
We, the Polish Nation - all citizens of the Republic,
Both those who believe in God as the source of truth, justice, good and beauty,
As well as those not sharing such faith but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources,
Equal in rights and obligations towards the common good - Poland,
Beholden to our ancestors for their labours, their struggle for independence achieved at great sacrifice, for our culture rooted in the Christian heritage of the Nation and in universal human values,
Recalling the best traditions of the First and the Second Republic,
Obliged to bequeath to future generations all that is valuable from our over one thousand years' heritage,
Bound in community with our compatriots dispersed throughout the world,
Aware of the need for cooperation with all countries for the good of the Human Family,
Mindful of the bitter experiences of the times when fundamental freedoms and human rights were violated in our Homeland,
Desiring to guarantee the rights of the citizens for all time, and to ensure diligence and efficiency in the work of public bodies,
Recognizing our responsibility before God or our own consciences,
Hereby establish this Constitution of the Republic of Poland as the basic law for the State, based on respect for freedom and justice, cooperation between the public powers, social dialogue as well as on the principle of subsidiarity in the strengthening the powers of citizens and their communities. We call upon all those who will apply this Constitution for the good of the Third Republic to do so paying respect to the inherent dignity of the person, his or her right to freedom, the obligation of solidarity with others, and respect for these principles as the unshakeable foundation of the Republic of Poland.

The Criminal Code
z dnia 6 czerwca 1997 r. (Dz.U. tłum. gb Nr 88, poz. 553)
Part General part. Chapter I. Principles of criminal liability. Art. 1. Conditions of liability. § 1. Only a person who commits an act punishable under the law in force at that time bears criminal liability. § 2. If the effects of a prohibited act on society are insignificant, it will not constitute an offence. § 3. The offender of a prohibited act does not commit an offence if no guilt can be attributed to him at that time. Art. 2. Criminal consequences by ommissionomission. Only a person with a specific legal duty to prevent criminal
consequences committed by omission bears criminal liability for an offence with such consequences. Art. 3. Humanitarian principles. Penalties and other measures provided for in this Code are applied with
humanitarian principles in mind, particularly with respect for human dignity. Art. 4. Changes in law. § 1. If the law in force when sentencing is different to the law in force when the offence was committed, the new
law will apply. However, the former law applies if it is more lenient for the offender. § 2. If the sentence concerns an act for which the sanction under the new law has a lower upper limit than the
sanction imposed, then the sanction will be lowered to the upper limit of the statutory sanction provided for the act
under the new law. § 3. If the sentence concerns an act that under the new law is no longer subject to imprisonment, an enforceable
sanction of imprisonment is commuted to a fine or the restriction of liberty, assuming that one month's
imprisonment is equivalent to 60 times the daily fine, or two months' restriction of liberty. § 4. If the sentence concerns an act that under the new law is no longer punishable, the sentence is cancelled by
virtue of the law. Art. 5. Territorial principles. Polish criminal law applies to an offender who commits a prohibited act in the Republic
of Poland, or on a Polish vessel or aircraft, unless the Republic of Poland is party to an international agreement
stating otherwise. Art. 6. Time and place of the offence. § 1. A prohibited act is deemed to have been committed at the time that the offender acts or fails to perform an
action that the offender is obliged to perform. § 2. A prohibited act is deemed to have been committed at the place where the offender acts or fails to perform an
action that the offender is obliged to perform, or where the results of the prohibited act take place, or are intended
by the offender to take place. Art. 7. Indictable and summary offence. § 1. An offence is either an indictable offence or a summary offence. § 2. An indictable offence is a prohibited act punished by imprisonment for at least three years, or a more severe
penalty. § 3. A summary offence is a prohibited act punished by a fine higher than 30 times the daily rate, the restriction of
liberty or imprisonment exceeding one month. Art. 8. Intent and lack of intent. An indictable offence must involve intent; a summary offence may be committed
without intent, where stated by the law. Art. 9. Additional information. § 1. A prohibited act is committed with intent when the offender wants to commit it, namely where there is a desire
to commit it or an acceptance of the foreseen possibility of committing the act. § 2. A prohibited act is committed without intent where the offender does not intend to commit it, but does so out of
a failure to exercise due care under the circumstances, even though the possibility of committing the prohibited act
was foreseen, or could have been foreseen. § 3. The offender bears more severe liability, which the law makes dependent on certain consequences of a
prohibited act, if the consequences were foreseen or could have been foreseen. Art. 10. Age. § 1. The provisions of this Code apply to anyone aged 17 or older who commits a prohibited act. § 2. The provisions of this Code may apply to minors aged 15 or older who commit a prohibited act set out in
Article 134, Article 148 §§1, 2 or 3, Article 156 §§ 1 or 3, Article 163 §§ 1 or 3, Article 166, Article 173 §§ 1 or 3,
Article 197 § 3 or 4, Article 223 § 2, Article 252 §§ 1 or 2 and in Article 280, if deemed appropriate given the
circumstances of the case and the level of mental development of the offender, the characteristics and personal
situation, and especially if previously attempts at educational or correctional measures have been ineffective. § 3. In the case set out in § 2, the sentence imposed may not exceed two-thirds of the statutory maximum
sentence for the offence attributed to the offender; the court may also apply an extraordinary mitigation of
punishment. § 4. If an offender commits a prohibited act after turning 17, but before turning 18 years old, the court will adopt
educational, therapeutic, or correctional measures prescribed for young offenders, instead of a penalty, if it is
deemed appropriate given the circumstances of the case and the level of mental developm

severe penalty, which does not prevent the court from imposing other measures provided for in law on the basis of
all the applicable provisions. Art. 12. Serial acts. Two or more prohibited acts undertaken at short intervals with premeditated intent are deemed
to be one prohibited act. If the offence involves an attack on personal interests, then multiple acts can only be
deemed a single prohibited act if they relate to the same aggrieved party. Chapter II. Forms of Committing an Offence. Art. 13. Attempt. § 1. Anyone who intends to commit a prohibited act and makes a direct attempt that is subsequently not
completed will be held liable for an attempt. § 2. An attempt also occurs when the offender is unaware that it is not possible to commit the act because there is
no suitable object on which to perpetrate the prohibited act, or because the tools used are not suitable for
perpetrating this prohibited act. Art. 14. Criminality. § 1. The sentence imposed by the court for an attempt will be within the limits of the penalty provided for the given
offence. § 2. In the case specified in Article 13 § 2, the court may apply an extraordinary mitigation of punishment, or even

penalty for the attempt. § 2. The court may apply an extraordinary mitigation of punishment to an offender who has voluntarily attempted
to prevent the consequences constituting a feature of the prohibited act. Art. 16. Preparation. § 1. Preparation only takes place when the offender, in order to commit a prohibited act, undertakes activities

particular by entering into an arrangement with another person, acquiring or preparing tools, gathering information
or concluding a plan of action for this purpose. § 2. Preparation is subject to a penalty only when established by the law. Art. 17. Preparation and absolute discharge. § 1. Anyone who voluntarily ceases the preparation, in particular by destroying prepared tools or preventing them
from being used in the future, is not subject to penalty. If an arrangement was entered into with another person in

Chapter VI. Principles of passing sentence and penal measures. Art. 53. General directive. § 1. The court passes a sentence at its own discretion, within the limits prescribed by law, ensuring that the
severity does not exceed the degree of guilt, being aware of the degree of social consequences of the act, and
taking into account the preventive and educational objectives that the penalty is to achieve with regard to the
offender, as well as the need to develop legal awareness in society. § 2. When passing sentence, the court will primarily take into account the motivation of the offender and the way
he or she acted, whether the offence was committed together with a minor, the type and degree of the breach of
duties the offender is charged with, the type and degree of any negative consequences of the offence, the
features and personal conditions of the offender, his or her lifestyle before committing the offence, and his or her
conduct afterwards, and in particular any efforts to redress the damage or to satisfy the public sense of justice in
any way. The court will also take the behaviour of the aggrieved party into account. § 3. When passing sentence, the court will also take into account the positive results of mediation between the
aggrieved party and the offender, or any settlement they may have reached in the proceedings before the
prosecutor or the court. Art. 54. Sentencing minors or juveniles. § 1. When passing sentence on a minor or a juvenile, the court will primarily aim at rehabilitating the offender. § 2. An offender who was under the age of 18 at the time of committing of the offence will not be sentenced to life
imprisonment. Art. 55. Individualisation. Circumstances affecting the sentence passed are only taken into account for the person
they relate to. Art. 56. Relevant application. The provisions of Article 53, Article 54 § 1 and Article 55 apply accordingly when
imposing other measures provided for in this code. Art. 57. Grounds for mitigation and aggravation. § 1. If there are several independent grounds for the extraordinary mitigation or aggravation of a penalty, the court
may mitigate or aggravate the penalty only once, having considered all the grounds for mitigation or aggravation. § 2. If there are coinciding grounds for an extraordinary mitigation and aggravation, the court may adopt an
extraordinary mitigation or aggravation of the penalty. Art. 57a. Exemplary damages. § 1. For an offence involving hooliganism, the court will pass a sentence at a level not lower than one and a half
times the statutory minimum provided for the offence attributed to the offender. § 2. In the case described in § 1, the court will order exemplary damages to the aggrieved party, unless it orders
the redress of damage, compensation for damages suffered or exemplary damages in accordance with Article 46. If the aggrieved party has not been determined, the court may order exemplary damages in favour of the Victim

that the offender would not pay the fine, and where enforcement would not be possible. 1111501

§ 2a. The restriction of liberty in connection with the obligation mentioned in Article 35 § 1 is not imposed if the
health condition of the accused, or his or her personal attributes and status, give grounds to suspect that the
accused will not perform this obligation. § 3. If the offence is subject to imprisonment for up to five years, the court may, instead of imposing this penalty,
impose a fine or a penalty of the restriction of liberty for up to two years, particularly where it imposes penal
measures at the same time; the penalty of the restriction of liberty is measured in terms of months and years. § 4. The provision of § 3 does not apply to the offender of an offence involving hooliganism, or to an offence set
out in Article 178a § 4. Art. 59. Lowering the penalty. § 1. If the offence is subject only to imprisonment for up to three years, or to a lesser penalty, and the social
impact of the act is not significant, the court may decide to impose a penal measure instead of the penalty, where
the aim of the penalty is performed by the measure. § 2. The provision of § 1 does not apply to the offender of an offence involving hooliganism. Art. 60. Extraordinary mitigation. § 1. The court may apply an extraordinary mitigation of the penalty in the cases set out by law, or in connection
with a juvenile, where this is justified by the circumstances described in Article 54 § 1. § 2. The court may also apply an extraordinary mitigation of the penalty in particularly justified cases, where even
the lowest penalty stipulated for the offence in question would be incommensurate, and particularly:
1) if the aggrieved party and the offender have been reconciled, if the damage incurred has been redressed, or
the aggrieved party and the offender have agreed on how the damage will be redressed,
2) given the attitude of the offender, particularly if he or she attempted to redress the damage or prevent the
damage from occurring,
3) if an offender of an unintentional offence, or a next of kin, has suffered serious damage in connection with the
offence committed. § 3. The court will apply an extraordinary mitigation of the penalty, or may even grant a suspended sentence, with
respect to an offender who acted in concert with others in committing an offence, then reveals information to the
prosecutors about other offenders involved in committing the offence, or the essential circumstances thereof. § 4. At the motion from the prosecutor, the court may apply an extraordinary mitigation of the penalty, or even
grant a conditional suspended sentence, with respect to an offender, who, irrespective of any explanations given
in his or her case, provides prosecutors with substantial assistance concerning an offence that they did not
previously known about, and which is subject to imprisonment for more than five years. § 5. In the cases referred to in §§ 3 and 4, where the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for up to five
years, it may conditionally suspend the sentence for a probation period of up to 10 years if it recognises that, in
spite of not serving the penalty, the offender will not reoffend; the provisions of Articles 71-76 apply accordingly. § 6. The extraordinary mitigation of a penalty consists in imposing a penalty below the minimum statutory
sentence, or imposing a less severe type of penalty, in accordance with the following principles:
1) if the act in question involves a minimum sentence of 25 years imprisonment, the court will impose a penalty of
imprisonment for not less than eight years;
2) if the act in question constitutes an indictable offence, the court will impose a penalty of not less than one-third
of the minimum statutory sentence;
3) if the act in question constitutes a summary offence, and the minimum statutory sentence is not less than one
year's imprisonment, the court will impose either a fine, the penalty of the restriction of liberty or imprisonment;
4) if the act in question constitutes a summary offence, and the minimum statutory sentence is less than one
year's imprisonment, the court will impose either a fine or the restriction of liberty. § 7. If the act in question is alternatively subject to the penalties specified in Article 32 sections 1-3, the
extraordinary mitigation of a penalty will consist in an absolute discharge, and the imposition of a penal measure
as specified in Article 39 sections 2-8; the provision of Article 61 § 2 does not apply. Art. 61. Absolute discharge. § 1. The court may grant an absolute discharge in the cases specified by law or in the case provided for in Article
60 § 3, particularly if the role of the offender played a minor role in committing the act, and the information
provided helped to prevent another offence from being committed. § 2. When granting an absolute discharge, the court may refrain from ordering a penal measure, even if ordering it
is mandatory. Art. 62. Choice of institution and therapeutic method. Upon deciding to impose imprisonment, the c

determine the type of penal institution where the offender is to serve the term, and may set out the therapeutic
methods to be used. Art. 63. Crediting custody towards imprisonment. § 1. The period of actually being in custody in a given case, rounded to a full number of days, is credited towards
imprisonment, with one day in custody equalling one day of imprisonment, or two days of the restriction of liberty,
or two daily units of a fine. § 2. The period of the relevant preventive measures specified in Articles 275 or 276 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure actually being applied, is credited towards the penal measures imposed specified in Article 39 sections
2 and 3 of this Code. Chapter VII. Relapse to crime. 1111501

Art. 64. Reoffending. § 1. If an offender who has been sentenced to imprisonment for an intentional offence and has served at least six
months of the penalty, then commits an intentional offence similar to the offence for which he or she was
sentenced within a five-year period, the court may impose the penalty of imprisonment for that offence, up to one
and a half times the maximum statutory limit. § 2. If an offender who has been sentenced under the conditions specified in §1, and has served in total at least
one year's imprisonment, commits another intentional offence against life or health, or the offence of rape,
robbery, theft with burglary, or another offence against property, using violence or the threat of violence within five
years after serving all or part of the last penalty, the court will impose the penalty of imprisonment for that offence
in excess of the lower statutory limit, or up to one and a half times the maximum statutory penalty. § 3. Raising the maximum statutory penalty as set out under §§ 1 or 2, does not apply to indictable offences. Art. 65. Permanent income; acting in a group or association. § 1. The provisions regarding the level of the penalty, the penal measures and measures relating to placing an
offender on probation, as provided for the offender as referred to in Article 64 § 2, also apply to an offender whose
permanent source of income comes from committing offences, or who commits offences acting in an organised
group or in an association whose purpose is to commit offences, or offenders of acts of terrorism. § 2. For an offender of the offence set out in Article 258, the regulations set out in Article 64 § 2 apply, except for
the increased penalty set out in that provision. Chapter VIII. Measures relating to placing an offender on probation. Art. 66. Conditional discontinuance. § 1. The court may conditionally discontinue criminal proceedings if the fault and the social consequences of the
act are not significant, if there are no doubts about the circumstances under which it was committed, and if the
attitude of the offender, who has not previously been penalised for an intentional offence, as well as his or her
personal characteristics and way of life to date, provide reasonable grounds to assume that even if the
proceedings are discontinued, he or she will observe the legal order, and particularly that he or she will not commit
an offence. § 2. There will be no conditional discontinuance for the offender of an offence for which the statutory penalty
exceeds three years' imprisonment. § 3. If the aggrieved party has been reconciled with the offender, the offender has redressed the damage, or the
aggrieved party and the offender have agreed on the method of redressing the damage, a conditional
discontinuance may apply to an offender of an offence for which the statutory penalty does not exceed five years'
imprisonment. Art. 67. Term of probation, supervision and obligations. § 1. A conditional discontinuance will be made for a term of probation of between one and two years, which runs
from the date that the sentence comes into force. § 2. If criminal proceedings are conditionally discontinued, the court may place the offender under the supervision
of a probation officer or a person of public trust, an association, or a social organisation involved in educating
offenders, preventing them from moral corruption, or providing assistance to them, for the duration of the probation
period. § 3. If criminal proceedings are conditionally discontinued, the court will require the offender to redress all or part
of the damage, and may impose the obligation specified in Article 72 § 1 sections 1-3 or 5-6a, 7a or 7b, or
exemplary damages, and may also adjudicate a monetary performance as specified in Article 39 section 7, and
disqualification from driving a vehicle, as specified in Article 39 section 3, for up to two years. When imposing on
an offender of an offence using violence or the unlawful threat of violence towards a next of kin the measure
mentioned in Article 72 § 1 section 7b, the court sets out the method for contact between the offender and the
aggrieved party. § 4. The provision of Article 74 applies accordingly. Art. 68. Resumption of criminal proceedings. § 1. The court will resume the criminal proceedings if, during the probation period, the offender commits an
intentional offence for which he or she has already been sentenced. § 2. The court may resume the criminal proceedings if, during the probation period, the offender blatantly violates
the legal order, and particularly if he or she commits an offence other than that specified in § 1, or avoids
supervision, fails to perform the obligations or penal measures imposed, or does not perform the settlement
concluded with the aggrieved party. § 2a. The court resumes criminal proceedings if the circumstances referred to in § 2 occur after the offender

intentional offence for which he or she has already been sentenced. § 2. The court may resume the criminal proceedings if, during the probation period, the offender blatantly violates
the legal order, and particularly if he or she commits an offence other than that specified in § 1, or avoids
supervision, fails to perform the obligations or penal measures imposed, or does not perform the settlement
concluded with the aggrieved party. § 2a. The court resumes criminal proceedings if the circumstances referred to in § 2 occur after the offender
receives a written warning from the court-appointed professional guardian, unless there are special reasons not to
do so. § 3. The court may resume the criminal proceedings if, after the decision on the conditional discontinuance was
passed but before it becomes final, the offender blatantly violates the legal order, and particularly if he or she
commits an offence within that time. § 4. Conditionally discontinued criminal proceedings cannot be resumed more than six months after the expiry of
the probation period. Art. 69. Suspended sentence. § 1. The court may conditionally suspend a penalty of imprisonment for up to two years, or a one-off fine, if this is
sufficient to achieve the objectives of the penalty with respect to the offender, and particularly to prevent a relapse
into crime. § 2. In suspending the execution of a penalty, the court will primarily take into consideration the attitude of the
offender, his or her personal characteristics and conditions, his or her lifestyle and his or her conduct after
committing the offence. 1111501

§ 3. A penalty will not be suspended for an offender as specified in Article 64 § 2, unless there is an exceptional
case justified by extraordinary circumstances; the penalty specified in Article 60 §§ 3-5 will not be suspended for
an offender as specified in Article 64 § 2. § 4. A penalty of the restriction of liberty or a fine will not be suspended for an offender of an offence involving
hooliganism. The court may conditionally suspend a penalty of imprisonment in particularly justified cases for
offences involving hooliganism or offences set out in Article 178a § 4. Art. 70. Probation period. § 1. A penalty will be suspended for a probation period running from the time the sentence becomes final, for:
1) from two to five years - in the case of a suspended sentence of a penalty of imprisonment,
2) from one to three years - in the case of a suspended sentence of a fine or a penalty of the restriction of liberty. § 2. For a suspended sentence of the penalty of imprisonment with respect to a young offender or an offender as
specified in Article 64 § 2, the probation period is from three to five years. Art. 71. Fine. § 1. If the execution of a penalty of imprisonment is suspended, the court may impose a fine of up to 270 times the
daily unit, if it cannot be imposed on any other basis. In suspending the execution of a penalty of restriction of
liberty, the court may impose a fine of up to 135 times the daily unit. § 2. If the execution of the penalty of imprisonment or restriction of liberty is ordered, the fine adjudicated under §
1 does not have to be paid; the penalty of imprisonment or restriction of liberty will be reduced by the number of
days equal to the number of daily fines paid, rounded up to the nearest full day. Art. 72. Obligations. § 1. If the execution of a penalty is suspended, the court may oblige the offender:
1) to keep the court or the probation officer informed about the progress of the probation period,
2) to apologise to the aggrieved party,
3) to carry out an imposed duty to provide support to another person,
4) to perform paid work, educational activity or vocational training,
5) to cease any abuse of alcohol or other intoxicants,
6) to submit to medical treatment, particularly detoxification or rehabilitation or therapeutic treatment,
6a) to attend rehabilitation or educational programmes,
7) to cease being in certain communities and locations,
7a) to avoid contact with the aggrieved party, or other parties in an indicated manner,
7b) to leave residential premises shared with the aggrieved party,
8) to undertake any other appropriate conduct in the probation period, if it may prevent a further offence. § 1a. When imposing the measure set out in point 7b on the offender of an offence using an unlawful threat
against a next of kin, the court determines how the offender may have contact with the aggrieved party. § 2. The court may order the offender to redress all or part of the damage, unless it has ordered the penal
measure specified in Article 39 section 5, or to make the monetary performance specified in Article 39 section 7. Art. 73. Supervision. § 1. In suspending a sentence, the court may place the offender under the supervision of a probation officer or a
person of public trust, an association, or a social organisation involved in educating offenders, preventing them
from moral corruption, or providing assistance to them, for the duration of the probation period. § 2. Supervision is mandatory for a young offender sentenced for an intentional offence, an offender specified in
Article 64 § 2, and an offender of an offence involving a sexual disorder. Art. 74. Additional information. § 1. The court determines the time and the manner of executing the imposed obligations, as specified in Article 72,
after hearing from the offender; imposing the obligation specified in Article 72 § 1 section 6 requires additional
consent from the offender. § 2. If warranted by educational or general care considerations, the court may, during the probation period,
impose, extend or modify the obligations mentioned in Article 72 § 1 sections 3-8, imposed on a person with a
conditional suspended sentence of imprisonment, or may waive these obligations, with the exception of the
obligation specified in Article 72 § 2, and may either have the offender monitored or cease any monitoring. § 3. If the offender has been placed under supervision or obliged to perform certain obligations during a period of
probation, the court-appointed professional guardian, or by a trustworthy person or a representative of the
association, institution or social organisation referred to in Article 73 § 1 may also submit an application to
determine the time and manner of performing such obligations. Art. 75. Execution of sentence. § 1. The court will order the sentence to be carried out if, during the probation period, the convicted offender

conditional suspended sentence of imprisonment, or may waive these obligations, with the exception of the
obligation specified in Article 72 § 2, and may either have the offender monitored or cease any monitoring. § 3. If the offender has been placed under supervision or obliged to perform certain obligations during a period of
probation, the court-appointed professional guardian, or by a trustworthy person or a representative of the
association, institution or social organisation referred to in Article 73 § 1 may also submit an application to
determine the time and manner of performing such obligations. Art. 75. Execution of sentence. § 1. The court will order the sentence to be carried out if, during the probation period, the convicted offender
commits an intentional offence similar to the one he or she was validly and finally sentenced to imprisonment for. § 1a. The Court manages the execution of a sentence if the offender is convicted for an offence involving violence
or the threat of violence against a next of kin or another minor co-residing with the offender during an attempt to
flagrantly violate the legal order, repeatedly using violence or the threat of violence against a next of kin or another
minor co-residing with the offender. § 2. The court may order the sentence to be carried out if, in the probation period, the offender blatantly breaches
the legal order, and in particular if he or she commits an offence other than that specified in § 1, fails to pay a fine,
evades supervision, or fails to perform the obligations or penal measures imposed. § 3. The court may order the sentence to be carried out if, after the sentence was given but before it became valid
and final, the offender flagrantly breached the legal order, and in particular if he or she committed an offence
within that time. § 4. The order to carry out the sentence may not be issued any later than 6 months after the end of the probation
period. § 5. If the offender has been placed under supervision, or obliged to perform certain obligations during a period of
probation, the professional court-appointed guardian, as well as a trustworthy person or a representative of the
association, institution or social organisation referred to in Article 73 § 1 may also submit an application for the

enforcement of the penalty. Art. 76. Spent Conviction. § 1. The conviction is deemed spent by force of law six months from the termination of the probation period. § 2. If a fine or a penal measure is imposed upon the convicted offender, the conviction will not become spent
before payment is made or the measure is carried out, or before it is barred by limitation; this does not apply to the
penal measure specified in Article 39 section 5. Art. 77. Release on licence. § 1. The court may only release on licence an offender sentenced to imprisonment from serving the balance of the
penalty, if his or her attitude, personal attributes and features, lifestyle prior to carrying out the offence, the
circumstances of the offence and the offender's conduct after committing the offence and while serving the
sentence, justify the assumption that the offender will, after release, respect the legal order, and in particular that
he or she will not re-offend. § 2. In particularly justified cases, when passing a sentence of imprisonment, the court may impose stricter
restrictions to prevent the possibility of the offender benefiting from a release on licence, other than those
specified in Article 78. Art. 78. Conditions. § 1. An offender may be released on licence after serving at least half of the sentence, and not less than six
months. § 2. The offender specified in Article 64 § 1 may be released on licence after serving two-thirds of the sentence,
and the offender specified in Article 64 § 2, after serving three-quarters of the sentence; the release on licence
may not occur before the lapse of one year. § 3. A person sentenced to 25 years imprisonment may be released on licence after serving 15 years of the
sentence, and a person sentenced to life imprisonment can be released on licence after serving 25 years of the
sentence. Art. 79. Conditions. § 1. The provisions of Article 78 §§ 1 and 2 apply accordingly to the sum of two or more penalties of imprisonment
that cannot be combined, which the sentenced person has to serve consecutively; the provision of Article 78 § 2
applies if at least one of the offences was committed under the conditions specified in Article 64. § 2. Notwithstanding the conditions specified in Article 78 §§ 1 or 2, the offender may be released on licence after
serving 15 years in prison. § 3. The provision of Article 78 § 3 applies accordingly if at least one of the penalties that cannot be combined,
which the offender has to serve consecutively, is a sentence of 25 years' imprisonment or life imprisonment. Art. 80. Probation period. § 1. Following a release on licence, the remainder of the sentence constitutes a probation period, and may not be
shorter than two years or longer than five years. § 2. If the convicted offender is the person specified in Article 64 § 2, the probation period may not be shorter than
three years. § 3. Following the release on licence of a person sentenced to life imprisonment, the probation period is 10 years. Art. 81. Repeat release on licence. Once a release on licence has been revoked, the convicted offender cannot be
released on licence again before serving one year in a criminal institution, and in case of life imprisonment, before
the lapse of five years. Art. 82. Sentence deemed as served. § 1. If the release on licence has not been revoked in the probation period or the subsequent six months, the
sentence will be considered to have been served at the time of the release on licence. § 2. If a judgment covers combined penalties from the which the offender has been released on licence, the
combined penalty will include only the period of the sentence actually to be served. Art. 83. Shortened restriction of liberty. A person sentenced to the restriction of liberty who has completed at least
half of the sentence, respected the legal order, diligently performed the work ordered by the court, and fulfilled the
obligations imposed upon him or her, may be released by the court from the remainder of the sentence, it being
considering as served. Art. 84. Shortened period of penal measures. § 1. After half of the period for which the penal measures specified in Article 39 sections 1-3 were imposed, the
court may consider them as served if the person sentenced has respected the legal order and has been subjected
to the penal measure for at least one year. § 2. The provision of § 1 does not apply if the penal measure specified in Article 39 section 3 has been
adjudicated under Article 41 § la, Article 41a § 3 or 42 §§ 2 or 3. § 3. The court may release an offender from the obligation imposed under Article 41b § 5 or 7 after half of the
period for which it has been imposed, if the obligation has been applied for at least one year, and the offender's
behaviour suggests that the continued application of the obligation is not necessary to meet the objectives of the

period for which it has been imposed, if the obligation has been applied for at least one year, and the offender's
behaviour suggests that the continued application of the obligation is not necessary to meet the objectives of the
penal measure. Art. 84a. Prohibition deemed as served. § 1. A permanent prohibition on being in certain communities and locations, or prohibition on contacting certain
individuals or on leaving a specific place of residence without the court's consent may be considered served if the
behaviour of the person sentenced after committing the offence, and during the period when the penalty is
performed, justifies the belief that, if the prohibition is lifted, he or she will not relapse into crimes against sexual
freedom or decency to the detriment of a minor, and the prohibition was in place for at least 10 years. § 2. In proceedings concerning further prohibitions as mentioned in § 1, the court hears expert opinions. § 3. An application by the offender or his or her defence counsel, submitted within two years of a decision being
issued refusing to lift the prohibitions mentioned under § 1, will not be considered. 1111501

Chapter IX. Concurrence of offences and the accumulation of penalties and penal measures. Art. 85. Cumulative penalty. If an offender has committed two or more offences before the first sentence for any of
these offences has been pronounced, even if it is not yet valid, and for which basic penalties of the same kind are
imposed, the court sets a cumulative penalty on the basis of the separate penalties imposed for the concurrent
offences. Art. 86. Size of a cumulative penalty. § 1. The court imposes a cumulative penalty within the limit of the highest penalties imposed for individual
offences, but not exceeding 810 times the daily unit of a fine, two years' restriction of liberty or 15 years'
imprisonment; a sentence of the restriction of liberty is measured in months and years. The cumulative fine
specified in Article 71 § 1 may not exceed 270 times the daily unit of a fine if it is connected with a suspended
prison sentence, and may not exceed 135 times the daily unit of a fine if it is associated with a suspended
sentence for the restriction of liberty. § 1a. If the total cumulated prison sentence is 25 years or more, where at least one of the sentences is for not less
than 10 years, the court may issue a cumulative sentence of 25 years imprisonment. § 2. In imposing a cumulative fine, the court redetermines the value of the daily unit of a fine, based on the
recommendations specified in Article 33 § 3; the level of daily units of fines may not, however, exceed the level
determined previously. § 2a. If at least one of the cumulative fines is a specific amount, then the cumulated fine is given as a specific
amount. § 2b. If at least one of the cumulative fines was imposed on the basis of Article 309, then the court imposes a
cumulated fine from the maximum fine for this kind of offence to a sum not exceeding 4500 daily units. § 3. In imposing a cumulative penalty of the restriction of liberty, the court redetermines the amount of supervised
unpaid community service work, or the amount of deductions, in accordance with Article 35; the obligations
specified in Article 36 § 2 apply even if adjudicated for only one of the concurrent offences. Art. 87. Cumulative penalty - imprisonment and restriction of liberty. When sentencing concurrent offences with
penalties of imprisonment and the restriction of liberty, the court imposes a cumulative penalty taking one month's
restriction of liberty as equal to 15 days' imprisonment. Art. 88. Most severe cumulative penalty. If the most severe penalty imposed for one of the concurrent offences is
the penalty of 25 years imprisonment or life imprisonment, then this penalty is imposed as the cumulative penalty;
for the accumulation of two or more penalties of 25 years' imprisonment, the court may impose a sentence of life
imprisonment as the cumulative penalty. Art. 89. Suspension of sentence. § 1. When sentencing for concurrent offences with penalties of imprisonment, the restriction of liberty or a fine,
with or without a suspended sentence, the court may conditionally suspend the execution of the cumulative
penalty if the conditions specified in Article 69 are met. § 1a. When sentencing for concurrent offences with penalties of imprisonment with a suspended sentence, the
court may, in the cumulative sentence, impose a penalty of the restriction of liberty without a suspended sentence. § 2. In imposing a cumulative sentence of imprisonment or the restriction of liberty with a suspended sentence, the
court may impose a fine as specified in Article 71 § 1, even if none has been imposed for the concurrent offences. § 3. In the case of concurrence sentences with probation periods, the court reinstates this period and the
associated obligations. Art. 90. Penal measures and preventive measures. § 1. Penal measures and preventive measures, including supervision, apply even if they were imposed with regard
to only one of the concurrent offences. § 2. If the sentence for concurrent offences involves the deprivation of civil rights or prohibitions or duties of a
particular kind, the court applies the provisions concerning cumulative penalties accordingly. Art. 91. Serial offences. § 1. If the offender committed two or more offences in a similar manner, in a short amount of time, before the first
sentence was pronounced for any of these offences, even though not yet valid final, the court imposes one
sentence on the basis of the provision covering each of these offences, where the sentence is up to the upper
statutory limit, increased by a half. § 2. If the offender, under the conditions specified in Article 85, commits two or more of a series of offences
specified in § 1, or a series of offences plus another offence, the court imposes an cumulative sentence applying
the relevant provisions of this chapter. § 3. If the offender has been sentenced to two or more sentences for offences belonging to a series of offences as
specified in § 1, the penalty imposed in a cumulative sentence

statutory limit, increased by a half. § 2. If the offender, under the conditions specified in Article 85, commits two or more of a series of offences
specified in § 1, or a series of offences plus another offence, the court imposes an cumulative sentence applying
the relevant provisions of this chapter. § 3. If the offender has been sentenced to two or more sentences for offences belonging to a series of offences as
specified in § 1, the penalty imposed in a cumulative sentence may not exceed the upper statutory limit for the
penalty, further increased by half, as stipulated in the provisions covering each of these offences. Art. 92. Cumulative penalties. The fact that separate penalties imposed for offences in a series of offences or
concurrent offences have already been partially or fully served, does not prevent a cumulative penalty being
imposed. The provision of Article 71 § 2 applies accordingly. Art. 92a. Application of foreign judgements. Combined judgments do not include convictions issued in other
Member States of the European Union. 1111501

Chapter X. Preventive Measures. Art. 93. Basis. Unless it is necessary in order to prevent an offender from relapsing into crime by committing a
prohibited act connected with a mental disease, mental impairment or addiction to alcohol or drug addiction, the
court cannot impose a preventive measure as provided for in this chapter, involving committing the offender to a
closed medical institution. Before imposing such a measure, the court hears psychiatrists and a psychologist, and
in cases involving a person with a sexual preference disorder, also a sexologist. Art. 94. Non-accountability and psychiatric institutions. § 1. If the offender commits a prohibited act involving significant damage to the community while in a state of non-
accountability, as specified in Article 31 § 1, and it is highly likely that he or she will commit such an act again, the
