The idea of development or progress
has always been with us. We have
aspirations or desires about what we
would like to do and how we would
like to live. Similarly, we have ideas
about what a country should be like. What are the essential things that we
require? Can life be better for all? How
should people live together? Can there
be more equality? Development
involves thinking about these
questions and about the ways in
which we can work towards achieving
these goals. This is a complex
task and in this chapter we shall
make a beginning at understanding
development. You will learn more
about these issues in greater depth
in higher classes. Also, you will find
answers to many of these questions
not just in economics but also in your
course in history and political science. This is because the way we live today
is influenced by the past. We can’t

300 districts have reported a water level decline of over 4 metres

groundwater, if we use more than this way add to the stock. However,
what is being replenished by rain then over time, even this will get exhausted. we would be overusing this resource.

Look at the following data for crude oil. TABLE 1.7 CRUDE OIL RESERVES
Region/Country Reserves (2013) Number of Years
(Thousand Million Barrels) Reserves will last
Middle East 808.5 78.1
United States of America 44.2 12.1
World 1687.9 53.3
Source : BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2014
The table gives an estimate of reserves of crude oil (column1). More
important, it also tells us for how many years the stock of crude oil will
last if people continue to extract it at the present rate. The reserves would
last only 53 years more. This is for the world as a whole. However, different
countries face different situations. Countries like India depend on
importing oil from abroad because they do not have enough stocks of
their own. If prices of oil increase this becomes a burden for everyone. There are countries like USA which have low reserves and hence want
to secure oil through military or economic power. The question of sustainability of development raises many
fundamentally new issues about the nature and process of development. (a) Is crude oil essential for the development process in a country? Discuss. (b) India has to import crude oil. What problems do you anticipate for the
country looking at the above situation? DDDDD 1111155555

no longer region or nation specific. development or progress is perennial. Our future is linked together. At all times as a member of society
Sustainability of development is and as individuals we need to ask
comparatively a new area of where we want to go, what we wish to
knowledge in which scientists, become and what our goals are. So
economists, philosophers and other the debate on development continues. EXERCISES
1. Development of a country can generally be determined by
(i) its per capita income
(ii) its average literacy level
(iii) health status of its people
(iv) all the above
2. Which of the following neighbouring countries has better performance in terms of
human development than India? (i) Bangladesh
(ii) Sri Lanka
(iii) Nepal
(iv) Pakistan
3. Assume there are four families in a country. The average per capita income of
these families is Rs 5000. If the income of three families is Rs 4000, Rs 7000
and Rs 3000 respectively, what is the income of the fourth family? (i) Rs 7500
(ii) Rs 3000
(iii) Rs 2000
(iv) Rs 6000
4. What is the main criterion used by the World Bank in classifying different
countries? What are the limitations of this criterion, if any? 5. In what respects is the criterion used by the UNDP for measuring development
different from the one used by the World Bank? 6. Why do we use averages? Are there any limitations to their use? Illustrate with
your own examples related to development. 7. Kerala, with lower per capita income has a better human development ranking
than Maharashtra. Hence, per capita income is not a useful criterion at all and
should not be used to compare states. Do you agree? Discuss. 8. Find out the present sources of energy that are used by the people in India. What
could be the other possibilities fifty years from now? 9. Why is the issue of sustainability important for development? 1111166666 UUUUU EEEEE DDDDD

10.“The Earth has enough resources to meet the needs of all but not enough to
satisfy the greed of even one person”. How is this statement relevant to the
disscusion of development? Discuss. 11. List a few examples of environmental degradation that you may have observed
around you. 12.For each of the items given in Table 1.6, find out which country is at the top and
which is at the bottom. 13.The following table shows the proportion of undernourished adults in India. It is
based on a survey of various states for the year 2001. Look at the table and
answer the following questions. State Male Female
(%) (%)
Kerala 22 19
Karnataka 36 38
Madhya Pradesh 43 42
All States 37 36
(i) Compare the nutritional level of people in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh. (ii) Can you guess why around 40 per cent of people in the country are
undernourished even though it is argued that there is enough food in the
country? Describe in your own words. ADDITIONAL PROJECT / ACTIVITY
Invite three different speakers to talk to you about the development of your region. Ask
them all the questions that come to your mind. Discuss these ideas in groups. Each
group should prepare a wall chart, giving reasons about ideas that you agree or do
not agree with. DDDDD 1111177777
